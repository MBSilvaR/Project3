# Project3

NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER touch MASTER or LEAVE A BRANCH WITHOUT COMMITTING 

whenever starting work, be in local development branch

then git pull origin development

then make a new branch for your work - git co -b branch_name_here

then do your work IN THE CREATED BRANCH

once the code works/is functional/or achieves the goal then add, commit, and push to development

then enter develoment, delete the branch you just completed then PULL FROM DEVELOPMENT - git pull origin development (no master EVER)

then start new work in new branch 

NEVER TOUCH MASTER

IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE YOU CANNOT REVERT INSIDE YOUR BRANCH

move to development branch, delete the branch with bad code, then PULL git pull origin development

then delete bad branch/ git branch -d name_of_bad_branch

then PULL FROM DEVELOPMENT

then make new branch to start again
